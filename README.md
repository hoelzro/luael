Luaed is a libedit binding for, you guessed it, Lua.

Why?
----

Because I wanted something to do.  Also, I plan to write
a command line tool in Lua, and I wanted to use a non-GPLed
library with readline-like functionality.

Building
--------

Currently, I just have a simple Makefile.  So just run 'make'
to build el.so.

Installing
----------

Nothing yet; just copy el.so to somewhere in your package.cpath!
